## Retrospective

### what went well
I did a good job variable and function nameing. for example I had lines like activePlayer.takeCard(deck.dealCard)
lines like that make sense and create highly readable code.
I had a very deep understanding of my code and one example of this is in the findPairs function.
I knew that this function would run everytime a card is given to a player so logically I decided to only check for pairs against cards[-1].
I had a few instances when it appered I was making mistakes like using a count in an enhanced for loop (in removePlayer()) however i added comments to exmplain how that was the correct choice.


### what didnt go well 
I had some functions like findPair() that would return the int pair found
however when there where no pairs it returned a 0. this feels off somehow and I wonder if I should have made a check for pairs() and then find pairs()



### what i learned for next time
I didnt learn until the end of the project all the helpful methods of the java Arrays class
I learned the importance of good function names. it made debugging much easier and created way more readble code.
